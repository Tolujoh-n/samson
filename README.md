# Samson Portfolio

## How to run it for the first time:

- You need to have Node and Git installed on your machine (you can search the net to do that to your computer)

## `git clone https://github.com/Tolujoh-n/samson.git`

## `cd samson`

## `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

## `npm start` to see your portfolio locally at port: http://localhost:3000/

# How to update your portfolio

## Open your samson folder on an editor (prefferably VScode) and see your portfolio datas in the data.json file inside the src folder. you can edit your portfolio data easy from those json data.

## After updating the data push back to github so that your repo can automatically update your live server, here is how to push your update

## Run `git add .`
## Run `git commit -m "port updated"`
## Run `git push origin main`

## Note: This 3 command above is what you'll be running anytime you make changes to your portfolio.

# Cheers

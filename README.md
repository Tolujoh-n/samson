# Samson Portfolio

## How to run it for the first time:

- You need to have Node and Git installed on your machine (you can search the net to do that to your computer)

## `git clone https://github.com/Tolujoh-n/samson.git`

## `cd samson`

## `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`

## `npm start` to see your portfolio locally at port: http://localhost:3000/

# How to update your portfolio

## Open your samson folder on an editor (prefferably VScode) and see your portfolio datas in the data.json file inside the src folder. you can edit your portfolio data easy from those json data.

## For Analysis data editing please enter the analysis file at /src/component/Analysis.jsx and edit the data in the file.

## The shortest and fastest way you can make changes to your portfolio is using the VScode search to search the word you wanna change in the portfolio. Most especially if you can't find it in data.json file

## After updating the data push back to github so that your repo can automatically update your live server, here is how to push your update

## Run `git add .`

## Run `git commit -m "port updated"`

## Run `git push origin main`

## Note: This 3 command above is what you'll be running anytime you make changes to your portfolio.

# Cheers
